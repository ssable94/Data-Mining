#Decision Tree Implementation

Implementation of recursive decision tree alogrithm using various parameters.

Methods implemented to chose best attribute and split value:
-----------------------------------------------------------
1. Gini
2. Information Gain

Methods implemented for preventing overfitting:
-----------------------------------------------
1. Pessimistic Error Estimate
2. Validation Set
3. Minimum Description Length

Directory Structure:

(Name of the directory - description)

* Beam Search over Decision Tree - Implementation of Beam Search in decision tree algorithm.

* Decision Tree with Overfitting Prevention Methods - Implementation of various overfitting prevention methods.
  * a - Pessimistic Error Estimate Implementation
  * b - Validation Set Implementation
  * c - Minimum Description Length Implementation

* Naive Decision Tree - Decision tree implementation without any overfitting preventation methods.

* cleaned - Processed and cleaned datasets, ready to be used as as input for the program.

* datasets - Datasets from UCI machine learning repository, these are not processed and cannot be directly used as an input for program.

* preprocessing - This directory contains code to process the and bring it in the format which can be fed as an input to the program.
